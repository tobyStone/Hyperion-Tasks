# Hyperion-Tasks
a selection of tasks from the University of York co-accredited Hyperion boot camp in coding.

These are both tasks set within the Bootcamp, and those necessary to 'pass' in order to be offered the Bootcamp.

Weirdly, the tasks (myLev- my version of Levenshtein's distance, reverseMatrix- a program to inverse matrices, and Prison Break- an iterative, window-sliding game) are all significantly more challenging than the tasks on the Bootcamp itself (write a for loop/while loop, etc...).
