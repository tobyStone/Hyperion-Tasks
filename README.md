# Hyperion-Tasks
a selection of tasks from the University of York co-accredited Hyperion boot camp in coding.

These are both tasks set within the Bootcamp, and those necessary to 'pass' in order to be offered the Bootcamp.

Weirdly, the tasks (myLev- my version of Levenshtein's distance, reverseMatrix- a program to inverse matrices, and Prison Break- an iterative, window-sliding game) are all significantly more challenging than the tasks on the Bootcamp itself (write a for loop/while loop, etc...).

I did, however, take the task9 (a calculator task) somewhat further than I was meant to, and am proud of the result: a parser that takes a number sentence from a text file, checks for non-numeric input, uses BODMAS to 'home in' on operators by precedence, then captures the operands on either side of the operators, and returns the result to the position of all three parts (two operands, one operator), so that it can be involved in the next step of BODMAS. It only works (at the moment) on the four basic operators.
