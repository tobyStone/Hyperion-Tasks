'''
based on learning from Hyperion.dev
first compulsory task set in T18
A program to set up an email class, pre-populate instances of this
with details of sender, subject line and content
and store these in a list. Once stored, the program
offers services such as reading specific emails
and reading all unread emails, changing the variable
of whether the emails have been read as it does so.
This is a resubmit. The read email option now
prints a numbered list of emails and subject lines
for the user to choose from. Thanks to Kelcey Webb
for feedback on this task.
